- SMOTE (Handling Class Imbalance)
- Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearch)
- Cross Validation
- Model Evaluation (Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC)

## Key Results
- High Recall for Fraud Detection
- Reduced False Positives
- Model Comparison Analysis

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Pandas / NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Power BI (for dashboard)
